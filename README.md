# heart-desease-prediction

OVERVIEW.
          we will be closely working with the heart disease prediction and for that, we will be looking into the heart disease dataset from that dataset we will derive           various insights that help us know the weightage of each feature and how they are interrelated to each other but this time our sole aim is to detect the               probability of person that will be affected by a savior heart problem or not.
          

TAKEWAYS.
         The Heart Disease prediction will have the following key takeaways:
         

Data insight:
      As mentioned here we will be working with the heart disease detection dataset and we will be putting out interesting inferences from the data to derive some meaningful results.
       
       
EDA:
     Exploratory data analysis is the key step for getting meaningful results.
     Feature engineering: After getting the insights from the data we have to alter the features so that they can move forward for the model building phase.
     Model building: In this phase, we will be building our Machine learning model for heart disease detection.
